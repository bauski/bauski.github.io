			Bauski's Hello World Test

		<p>
			Finally got Git running on my server, and cloned my github repo so that I can make changes using my FTP and SSH.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm going to keep on making little changes to this file, as well as adding new files to practice working with git and github
			through my server SSH... Maybe something for the future would be to create a php script on the server where I can just
			input the folder and it will do all the git stuff for me?
